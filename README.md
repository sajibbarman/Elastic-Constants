# Elastic-Constants
Generate POSCAR files for calculating elastic constants for a cubic system using VASP

Please run the script as python3 poscars-for-cubic-system-Cxx.py after placing the original POSCAR file in the same directory as the script.
This script will create three directories, C11, C12, and C44, for the cubic crystal. Inside each of these directories will be a set of POSCAR files generated for the execution of E-V calculations using VASP.
